Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences:

C# is a programming language, developed by Microsoft for .NET, and .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime 
which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run. Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the 
two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand that they are two very different things.
